// TODO: THREE (3) types of gases with different physics implementations (3 PHYSHOOKS.)
1. "Free" gas. Gas is floating and is represented with a matter.js physics object with minimal to low to negative gravity. Later implementations 
should make some reference of diffusion.
2. "Beaker" gas. Gas is locked in a beaker which is like any other matter.js (solid) object. It is transparent.
3. "Constrained" gas. Gas gets teleported into another object (like a Bounds) and gets "stuck". It is now NO LONGER matter.js object.
It is now "trapped" in the bounds, and the Bounds is responsible for displaying the "constrained" gas. 
This gas can be removed with a mouse, where it will at once turn into either "beaker" or "free" gas.
4?. "Global Constrained" gas. This is actually a special case of "constrained" gas. The gas is trapped/contrained, this time in the global system/bound.
With diffusion, eventually "free" gas should turn into "global constrained" gas - the gas "diffuses" into the global Bound. And if free gas happens
to be in a Bound with a lower hierarchy, diffusion could also have that "free" gas turned into "constrained" gas of that Bound.

SIMILARLY, WITH LIQUIDS:
1. "Free" liquid. Object should feel liquid-y, but still be easily manipulated by a mouse. It is still a matter.js physics obejct.
2. "Beaker" liquid. Liquid is locked in a beaker which is like any other matter.js (solid) object. It is transparent.
3. "Constrained" liquid. Liquid takes the place of its container (Bound), and sloshes around and gets "stuck". It's now "trapped" in the bounds
and the Bounds is responsible for displaying the "constrained" liquid. "Constrained" liquid is NO LONGER a matter.js object -
it is a display residue that is completely the responsibility of the Bound (container) to keep track of.
This liquid can be removed with a mouse, where it will at once turn into either "beaker" or "free" liquid.
4?. "Global Constrained" liquid. This is actually a special case of "constrained" liquid. The gas is trapped/contrained, this time in the global system/bound.
With diffusion, eventually "free" gas should turn into "global constrained" gas - the gas "diffuses" into the global Bound. And if free gas happens
to be in a Bound with a lower hierarchy, diffusion could also have that "free" gas turned into "constrained" gas of that Bound.
